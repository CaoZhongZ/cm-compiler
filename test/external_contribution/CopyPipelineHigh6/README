1 Sample Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Color copy pipeline sample demonstrates scanned image-enhancement pipeline for
printing.  The original version was developed and released through OpenVino's
OpenVX samples graph, which focus on heterogeneous execution. The copy pipeline
kernels execution are distributed to CPU, GPU and IPU.

Now, re-written using C for Metal language and all kernels execution are done in 
GPU only. To improve pipeline performance, several kernels are combined into one to
improve efficiency by reducing memory access and utilize internal GPU caches as
well as HW registers.

The sample takes in 32bit bitmap file and produces raw 1bpp CMYK in planar format.

Out of the original version which implemented 3 copy-paths, this sample only
focus on the highest complexity option, High6.

Here are the copy pipeline graph implemented in the High6 version.
                                                                                    
"RGB-to-Lab" -> "7x7 Filter" -> "Background Suppression" -> "Lightness/Darkness" 

-> "Basic Edge Detection"   -----------------\
                                               --> "Lab-to-CMYK" -> "Halftone" or "ErrorDiffusion"  -> "Pack8to1
-> "Advanced Enhancement of neutral edges" --/

2 System Requirements for Building and Running the Sample
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After all required drivers installation, use the Makefile.linux include in this
directory.

latest example requires libglags

sudo apt-get install libgflags-dev

make -f Makefile.linux

4 Basic Command-line Options
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: command line parameters (keys and values) are case-sensitive.

hw_x64.CopyPipelineHigh6 [OPTION]
Options:

   -h                          Print a usage message.
   -i <filename>               Path to an 24bit .bmp RGB image.  Default value: nest.bmp
   -o <filename>               Path to save 1bpp CMYK output image. Default: no output file
   --lightness <integer>       Lightness control where ranges -3 to 3. Default value: 0
   --contrast <integer>        Contrast control where ranges -2 to 2. Default value: 0.
   --maxframes <integer>       Maximum number of frames to run.
   --halftonepath              Halftone path. Default=no
   --edpath                    ErrorDiffusion path. Default=yes

Running Pipeline:

./hw_x64.CopyPipelineHigh6 -i <24bit bitmap input file> -o <output filename>

NOTE: Input image width needs to 128 bytes alignment.
