1 Sample Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Color copy pipeline sample demonstrates scanned image-enhancement pipeline for
printing.  The original version was developed and released through OpenVino's
OpenVX samples graph, which focus on heterogeneous execution. The copy pipeline
kernels execution are distributed to CPU, GPU and IPU.

Now, re-written using C for Media language and all kernels execution are done in 
GPU only. To improve pipeline performance, several kernels are combined into one to
improve efficiency by reducing memory access and utilize internal GPU caches as
well as HW registers.

The sample takes in 32bit bitmap file and produces raw 1bpp CMYK in planar format.

Out of the original version which implemented 3 copy-paths, this sample only
focus on the highest complexity option, High6.

Here are the copy pipeline graph implemented in the High6 version.
                                                                                    
"RGB-to-Lab" -> "7x7 Filter" -> "Background Suppression" -> "Lightness/Darkness" 

-> "Basic Edge Detection"   -----------------\
                                               --> "Lab-to-CMYK" -> "Halftone" -> "Pack8to1
-> "Advanced Enhancement of neutral edges" --/

Refer to link above to get the detail of each kernel.


2 System Requirements for Building and Running the Sample
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After all required drivers installation, use the Makefile.linux include in this
directory.

make -f Makefile.linux

                                          Lightness Contrast CM kernel)
    |-- Box_NeutralEdge (Box3x3 + Neutral Pixel Detection CM kernel)
    |-- Sobel_CalcGradient_Dilate_AndOr (Sobel3x3 + Calculate Gradient +
                                         Dilate3x3 + And + Or CM kernel)
    |-- Dilate_And (Dilate3x3 + And CM kernel)

    `-- Threshold_ProduceEdgeK (Simple threshold + ProduceEdgeK + Dilate3x3
                                + Pack8to1 CM kernel)

4 Basic Command-line Options
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: command line parameters (keys and values) are case-sensitive.
Running Pipeline:

./hw_x64.CopyPipelineHigh6 <32bit bitmap input file>

Use at least 1920x1080 pixels for input file.
