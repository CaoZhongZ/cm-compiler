How to build cmDNN
==================

Needs to modify the CM_ROOT in Makefile.linux pointing to your C-for-Metal
development package location. So "make" can find the compiler and 
runtime library. 

make -f Makefile.linux

How to run cmDNN
================

First, download the cmDNNData.tar.gz from our github release tab.

Second, extract the cmDNNData.tar.gz under x64 so that a Data subdirectory 
is created under x64. The following is the expected directory structure:

x64
 |
 *--Release
 |
 *--Data
      |
      *-- Alexnet
      |
      *-- Resnet50
      |
      *-- VGG16
      |
      *-- VGG19

cp hw_x64.cmDNN x64/Release
cp cmDNN/cmDNN_genx.isa x64/Release 
cd x64/Release
./run_Alexnet.sh
